<title>HTTP</title>
</head><body>HTTP = Hyper Text Transfer Protocol<br/>
designed to enable communications between clients and servers.<br/>
- Media independent - any type of data can be sent with HTTP as long as sender/reciever can process.<br/>
- Stateless - Server/client are aware of each other only when a data transaction is taking place.<br/>
------ Neither the client of server retains information.<br/>
<br/>
HTTP is not secure. Clear text usually served on port 80<br/>
<br/>
HTTPS = layering HTTP with SSL or TLS<br/>
----- Usually port 443<br/>
----- Creates a secure channel over an unsecure network. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
